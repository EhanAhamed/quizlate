# How to make a free.png

first, `free.blend` the `free.blend`

## scaling

after exporting, CROP 4 pixels away (away = 4 pixels empty space) from each edge (edge = last pixel on a side, including supertransparent pixels)

then SCALE with WIDTH=960 (locked proportions)

the height should be 803 if correctly cropped

SAVE

RE-OPEN saved img

RESIZE to WIDTH=1400 (UN-locked/FREE keep height 803)

SCALE to HEIGHT=800 (locked proportions)

RESIZE to WIDTH=1400 (UN-locked/FREE keep height 800)

SCALE to HEIGHT=400 (locked propertions)

RESIZE to WIDTH=800 (UN-locked/FREE keep height 400)

image should now be 800 x 400

SAVE
